    <p id="lyrics"><b> Nice to meet you, where you been?
        I could show you incredible thingss
        Saw you there and I thought
        "Oh, my God, look at that face
        You look like my next mistake
        Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay

        New money, suit and tie
        I can read you like a magazine
        Ain't it funny rumors fly
        And I know you heard about me
        So hey, let's be friends
        I'm dying to see how this one ends
        Grab your passport and my hand
        I can make the bad guys good for a weekend</b></p>
